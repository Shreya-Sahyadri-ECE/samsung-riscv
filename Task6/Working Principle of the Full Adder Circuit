Working Principle:

This circuit implements a Full Adder using the VSDSquadron Mini microcontroller. A Full Adder is a combinational logic circuit that performs the addition of three binary inputs:
A (Input 1)
B (Input 2)
Cin (Carry Input)

Working Steps:

Inputs Processing:
The three switches/buttons on the breadboard represent the binary inputs (A, B, Cin).
When pressed, they provide a HIGH (1), and when released, they provide a LOW (0).

Logic Operations (Full Adder Equation)
The circuit follows the Full Adder Boolean equations:
Sum (S) = A ⊕ B ⊕ Cin (XOR operation)
Carry (Cout) = (A ⋅ B) + (Cin ⋅ (A ⊕ B))

LED Output Indication:
A red LED represents the Sum output (S).
A green LED represents the Carry output (Cout).
Depending on the input combinations, the LEDs light up accordingly.

Microcontroller Processing:
The VSDSquadron Mini processes the logic and controls the LED outputs.

This Full Adder circuit is fundamental in digital electronics and is used in ALUs, processors, and arithmetic circuits.
