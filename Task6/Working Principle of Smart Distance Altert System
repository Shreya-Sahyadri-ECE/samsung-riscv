The Smart Distance Alert System works by using an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance of nearby objects. The VSDSquadron Mini processes this data and determines whether the object is too close based on a predefined threshold.

# Working Steps:
Distance Measurement:

The HC-SR04 sensor sends an ultrasonic pulse via the Trig pin.
The pulse reflects off an object and returns to the Echo pin.
The microcontroller calculates the distance using the time taken for the echo to return.
Processing & Alerts:

If the measured distance is less than the threshold, the buzzer sounds and the LED lights up to indicate an alert.
If the object is at a safe distance, both the LED and buzzer remain off.
Push Button Functionality:

The push button can be used to reset or control the system manually.
This setup is useful for proximity detection applications like parking sensors, obstacle avoidance in robotics, or social distancing alerts.
